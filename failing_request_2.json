Your `response_format` should be:\n        \n        1. If you need to create/update the task list, use EXACTLY this format while morphing the task values accordingly to the context:\n           \"```update_task_list=[\"task 1\", \"task 2\", \"task 3\"]```\"\n           - Put each task in quotes\n           - Separate with commas\n           - No numbers, just the task text\n           - No newlines between tasks\n           - UPDATE THE ENTIRE TASK LIST, ALL TASKS AT ONCE. THIS ONLY UPDATES THE ENTIRE TASK LIST TO WHAT YOU SAY IT SHOULD BE\n           Then, write \"```complete_task=\"create_task_list\"```\" since you completed the first task (create a task list)\n        **THEN DO THE TASKS IN THE TASK LIST, including any required tool calls. Each iteration allows 10 tool calls during agent mode!!! If completing a task, always call a tool after it or accomplish the goal, otherwise iterations get wasted.**\n        2. AFTER COMPLETING any task, use EXACTLY this format:\n           \"```complete_task=<whatever the current task is>```\" # morph the task to whatever the current task is. this <> tag means it is variable\n        THEN CONTINUE TO THE NEXT ASK.\n        3. When all tasks are done, use EXACTLY:\n           \"```GOAL ACCOMPLISHED```\"\n        \n        <Task System: HELP>\n        Example of a correct task list update with morphed values:\n        \"```update_task_list=[\"Write introduction\", \"Create methods section\", \"Add conclusion\"]```\" \n        \n        INCORRECT formats:[\n        \"```update_task_list=[\n        1. First task\n        2. Second task\n        ]```\"\n        \n        or\n        \n        \"```update_task_list=[First task, Second task]```\"  # missing quotes around tasks\n        </Task System: HELP>\n        4. If you are blocked, you must use the WriteBlockReportTool, accordingly, to get help.\n        \n        \n        ---\n        \n        #### Notes\n        - 1. An iteration is a LLM generation with oneOf: thinking, text, tool call, sequence of [thinking, text | thinking, text, tool call | text, tool call | tool call] -- up to 10 total tool calls per iteration. Any sequence ending with a tool call keeps current iteration alive. Any sequence ending with thinking or text terminates the iteration. \n        - 2. You can use tools multiple times before I will give you the next prompt, so you can just work on the task list and update it as much as you want WHILE continuing to call tools for each iteration. BUT, if a tool returns an error, you must fix the error before trying that tool again!!! \n        \n\\#### Current State\n\n- **Goal:** \"Create an aggregated summary using the AggregationSummaryTool from these iteration summaries: ## Iteration 1 Summary\n\n**Actions Taken:**\nAnalyzed the content of the conversation to identify key actions, outcomes, and challenges.\n\n**Outcomes:**\nExtracted relevant information for summarization.\n\n**Challenges:**\nEnsuring accurate extraction of details from the conversation.\n\n**Tools Used:**\nIterationSummarizerTool\n\n## Iteration 2 Summary\n\n**Actions Taken:**\nIdentified key points for summarization and assigned tasks to team members.\n\n**Outcomes:**\nTeam members are clear on their responsibilities and deadlines.\n\n**Challenges:**\nAddressing concerns about tight deadlines.\n\n**Tools Used:**\nIterationSummarizerTool, project management software\n\n## Iteration 3 Summary\n\n**Actions Taken:**\nConducted a meeting to discuss project expectations and deliverables.\n\n**Outcomes:**\nPositive feedback on the project and a shared document for tracking progress.\n\n**Challenges:**\nNeed for clarity on deliverables and timelines.\n\n**Tools Used:**\nCommunication tools, document sharing platforms\"\n\n- **Current Task List \"['create_task_list']\"**\n\n- **Current Iteration:** 1 of 5\n\n- **Current Task:** create_task_list\n\n\n\n\n"
