# Ideas Directory

This directory contains private development ideas and planning documents that are never included in public releases.

## Purpose
- Agent-generated feature ideas and concepts
- Development brainstorming and planning documents  
- Internal design discussions and prototypes
- Experimental features before they become issues

## Usage for Agents
Agents should document new ideas here before creating GitHub issues:
```
Agent generates idea → /ideas/feature_name.md → Idea matures → GitHub Issue → Development
```

## Privacy
- This directory is automatically excluded from public releases via GitHub Actions
- Content here remains private to the development team
- Safe space for experimental thinking and early concepts

## File Naming Convention
- Use descriptive names: `sghc_integration_thoughts.md`
- Include dates for time-sensitive ideas: `2025-01-auto_truncation_design.md`
- Organize by topic when possible

## Graduation to Issues
When an idea is ready for development:
1. Refine the concept in the idea file
2. Create a GitHub issue with clear requirements
3. Reference the idea file in the issue for context
4. Move to development workflow
