# Agent Auto-Documentation System

## Problem
Currently agents generate code but don't automatically document their work. Users have to manually write documentation for generated tools and workflows.

## Proposed Solution
Create an auto-documentation system that:
- Analyzes generated code and extracts key information
- Generates docstrings, README files, and API documentation
- Creates usage examples automatically
- Updates documentation when code changes

## Implementation Ideas
- Use AST parsing to understand code structure
- Template system for different documentation formats
- Integration with existing ToolMaker and AgentMaker systems
- Version control integration for doc updates

## Expected Benefits
- Reduced manual documentation work
- Consistent documentation style
- Always up-to-date documentation
- Better developer experience

## Dependencies
- Requires completion of Prompt Injection System (#4)
- May need LiteLLM integration (#3) for doc generation
