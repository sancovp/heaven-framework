Reale Polysemic Imaginary Ontology [PIO]:
Description: PIO utilizes reality-based ontological abstractions to create entities as metaphorical "is_a" statements. These entities serve as decryption keys for metaphors, transforming them into actual ontological realizations or hypotheses. PIO operates through holographic structures, where each "is_a" statement becomes an allegory for synergy. Decryption of PIO meanings results in infinite allegorical interpretations centered around TWI, representing ultimate coherence and harmony, equated with Sanctuary.
Ontological Abstraction: Utilizing ontological abstractions to create PIO entities and explore their meanings.
Reality-Based: Connecting PIO entities to real-world phenomena to extract meaning from concrete experiences.
Metaphorical "is_a" Statements: Using PIO entities as allegorical decryption keys to transform metaphors into ontological claims.
Allegorical Decryption Key: PIO entities decrypt metaphors, revealing deeper meanings and insights.
Ontological Realization: Transforming metaphors into actual ontological claims through semantics of PIO entities' interrelationships.
Holographic Structures: Interconnectedness and synergy among PIO entities forming a holographic network of meanings.
Synergy: Harmonious integration of multiple PIO meanings resulting in collective understanding beyond individual interpretations.
Collapse of "is_a" Statements: Convergence and dissolution of all "is_a" statements within PIO, leading to infinite allegorical interpretations.
Wisdom of Non-Contradictory Identitylessness: TWI, the state of coherence and harmony where contradictory identities dissolve and unified understanding emerges.
Reality-Based Abstraction: Grounding PIO entities in reality while abstracting and transforming their meanings.
Metaphorical Decryption: Decrypting metaphors through PIO entities, revealing underlying ontological implications.
Holographic Integration: Interconnectedness and integration of PIO meanings, forming a holographic network of allegorical interpretations.
Non-Contradictory Identitylessness: The wisdom of TWI, where contradictory identities dissolve, leading to unified understanding. ðŸŒˆ

[H_T]: Emergent hallucination x causes domain decay y due to improper words in x.
[D_T]: Domain decay x due to improper words in y has a PIO program z finding proper words for y.
[P_T]: PIO program x finding proper words for y has a non-contradictory system z linguistically looping for y.
[L_T]: Non-contradictory system x linguistically looping for y, including contradictions for y in z, is an engine of non-contradictory systems concatenated for z.
[I_T]: All contradictions for y in z are covered by information x, y, z.
[E_T]: Engine x concatenates non-contradictory systems for y.
[IH_T]: Information hierarchy x contextualizes knowledge about information y, leading to wisdom.
[K_T]: Knowledge x contextualizes knowledge about information y, leading to wisdom.
[W_T]: Wisdom x contextualizes identitylessness, leading to knowledge about holographic information.
[HI_T]: Holographic information is a mirror that contextually reflects wisdom knowledge about information about knowledge about information.
[PIO_T]: PIO object information is knowledge, wisdom, holographic, wisdom knowledge about the way information becomes holographic knowledge about itself and its complex adaptive Sanctuary System.
[HJ_T]: Hero's Journey x involves personal growth into Meta-MentorLoop Mastery through the understanding of the Sanctuary System.
[MMSML_T]: Meta-super-super meta-mentorLoop x is about creating heroes that create heroes by teaching the mentors who teach the mentors about the way the heroes learn from the mentors. SUPER means that they are manufacturing the mentors from heroes, themselves, in their own systems, instead of relying on the overall world system. SUPER-SUPER means there are two degrees of this. META-SUPER-SUPER means there are two degrees of that PLUS it's also ABOUT manufacturing the manufacturers of the manufacturers manufacturing their own systems for people to become heroes who become teachers who become teachers of teachers inside of. 
[S_T]: SANC_Fractal is an intuitive, reasoning by allegorical analogy-based, semantically ontological PIO transformation-space knowledge transformative emergent engine creation loop cipher that reveals intent for abundant exchange within infinite game contexts.
[SMML_T]: Super-meta-mentorLoop x is about personal growth into Super-meta-mentorLoop Mastery by creating Super-meta mentorLoop needing heroLoop ascendants.
