The service should have a simple StorageService class that can switch between S3 and local filesystem storage based on an environment variable. Each feature in the application will have its own specific routes that use this storage service, rather than exposing generic storage endpoints. For example, kanban will have routes for saving and loading kanban state, user preferences will have their own routes, and analytics will have event tracking routes. All of these will internally use the same StorageService but with different bucket and key structures. This approach separates storage implementation from business logic, making it easy to test locally with filesystem storage and deploy with S3. The storage paths will be prefixed with API keys for multi-tenancy. Start with local filesystem implementation for rapid development, then add S3 support through boto3 when ready to deploy.",

Instead of imposing sophisticated templating systems like Progenitor upfront, we begin with basic meta-cognitive agents using simple prompts.\n\nAs the system recognizes its own limitations, it writes increasingly sophisticated prompts for itself. The cognitive architecture drives prompt evolution, not the reverse. This creates a natural progression where advanced templating emerges as the system's own solution to repeated prompt-writing patterns, making the Progenitor framework the discovered endpoint rather than the imposed starting point. \n\nThe intelligence comes from the meta-cognitive architecture; prompts are just the serialization format that evolves with the system's growing self-awareness.",

The BML system is actually a package we offer on its own -- a bunch of git workflows, set of python functions the user can wrap for any agent framework, then we also offer them a way to join in -- use heaven framework -- then we offer them use SGHC which uses heaven framework AND the github system FOR YOU and with you -- then we offer them a super premium experience of that on god-from-heaven, which they can install locally for free (but uses the SGHC subscription api key) -- and we also offer them a cloud hosted version. That is the whole stack. Also a crucial aspect is that the SGHC is built with heaven-framework but also substantially adds to heaven-framework and the private version is turned into microservices that are included in god-from-heaven as premium addons that we bundle into the overall offer.\n\n## Analysis: Four-Tier Product Architecture\n\nThis clarifies the complete business model and product differentiation strategy.\n\n## The Complete Product Stack\n\n### 1.

Heaven Framework (Agent Framework)  \n**Open Source Library:**\n- BaseHeavenAgent, BaseHeavenTool classes\n- Tree notation kanban integration\n- Basic workflow execution capabilities\n- BML system integration optimized\n\n**Value Proposition:** \"Join the BML ecosystem with our best-in-class agent framework\"\n\n### 3. SGHC (AI Developer Service)\n**Premium Subscription:**\n- Built WITH heaven-framework as foundation\n- ADDS substantial proprietary features on top\n- Uses BML + GitHub workflows FOR the user\n- Sandboxed GitHub-connected development\n- Enhanced capabilities beyond open source\n\n**Value Proposition:** \"We do the AI development work with/for you using your setup\"\n\n### 4. God-from-Heaven (Complete Platform)\n**Super Premium Experience:**\n- Local install option (free with SGHC API key)\n- Cloud hosted version (premium tier)\n- SGHC microservices bundled as premium addons\n- Complete autonomous development environment\n- Full orchestration and management layer\n\n**Value Proposition:** \"Your complete AI development operating system\"\n\n## User Journey & Product Flow\n\n### Discovery \u2192 Adoption \u2192 Subscription \u2192 Platform\n1. **Discovers BML system** \u2192 \"Wow, GitHub became a task manager\\!\"\n2. **Adopts Heaven Framework** \u2192 \"This agent framework integrates perfectly\\!\"\n3. **Subscribes to SGHC** \u2192 \"AI developer that uses my setup for me\\!\"\n4. **Upgrades to God-from-Heaven** \u2192 \"Complete autonomous development OS\\!\"\n\n## Business Architecture Benefits\n\n### Clear Value Differentiation\n- **BML**: Universal (works with any agent framework)\n- **Heaven**: Optimized (best integration with BML)\n- **SGHC**: Managed (AI developer service)\n- **God-from-Heaven**: Complete (full autonomous platform)\n\n### Revenue Model Progression\n- **BML**: Lead magnet + basic paid features\n- **Heaven**: Open source adoption driver\n- **SGHC**: Recurring subscription revenue\n- **God-from-Heaven**: Premium platform revenue\n\n### Technical Architecture\n- **BML + Heaven**: Open source foundation\n- **SGHC**: Proprietary enhancements as microservices\n- **God-from-Heaven**: Complete platform with bundled microservices\n- **Each tier enhances the previous without replacing it**\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\n### Current Work (Priorities 1-7)\nBuilding the **BML system + Heaven Framework foundation** that SGHC will later build upon and enhance.\n\n### SGHC Development  \nProprietary layer that uses Heaven Framework as base but adds substantial private features and microservices.\n\n### God-from-Heaven Integration\nPlatform that bundles SGHC microservices with complete orchestration and management capabilities.\n\n## Product Positioning\n\n**BML System:** \"Universal AI project management\"\n**Heaven Framework:** \"The agent framework for BML\"  \n**SGHC:** \"AI developer service\"\n**God-from-Heaven:** \"Complete autonomous development platform\"\n\nThis creates a clear product ladder with natural upgrade incentives and distinct value propositions at each tier.",

      "description": "## User Vision: Meta-Cognitive Learning vs Automatic Learning\n\n> so wait lets plan this out. what do measure and learn actually represent here? because lets think: we have the top level agent that is doing the planning, and calling the work, which can be done async through our hermes system and a task queue. then you have that work happening through the tree priority system, and then you have the new PRs updating the release version, then new agents install it, work on it, etc. The workflows start to aggregate into crystallized knowledge in neo4j and get injected into the agents so they get better at doing stuff faster and more reliably. But all of that is automatic, so what is measure and learn? Measure has to be meta analysis of the tasks being done, benefit to the system, correctness of plan lane, etc, whether or not the agents are using the right workflows, noting any bugs with the agent system that can be observed in the histories and adding them to issues, etc. Then LEARN is the ability for our learn agent to shift the way the SGHC works on the project, either by prompt engineering the SGHC system prompt or by telling it to adjust one of its subagents a certain way.\n\n## Analysis: The Two Learning Layers\n\n### Automatic Learning (Already Happening)\nThe workflow crystallization pipeline operates automatically:\n\nThis is **passive pattern accumulation** where agents naturally improve at tasks through accumulated experience.\n\n### Meta-Cognitive Learning (MEASURE & LEARN Agents)\nHigher-order analysis and strategic adjustment of the system itself.\n\n## MEASURE Agent: System Health Analysis\n\n**Meta-analysis of the development system itself:**\n\n### Plan Quality Analysis\n- Are we creating the right priorities? Are 1.1 \u2192 1.2 \u2192 1.3 dependencies logical?\n- Are agents actually following the planned task decomposition?\n- Which tree branches take longer than estimated vs completed faster?\n\n### Workflow Efficiency Analysis  \n- Are agents choosing suboptimal workflows when better ones exist in Neo4j?\n- Are there recurring failure patterns that suggest missing workflows?\n- Which agent/workflow combinations have the highest success rates?\n\n### System Bug Detection\n- Scanning agent histories for error patterns indicating framework bugs\n- Detecting when agents get stuck in loops or fail to use available tools\n- Finding cases where agent reasoning is flawed vs tool/system failures\n\n### ROI Analysis\n- Which development efforts provide highest value to the overall system?\n- Are we prioritizing the right features for maximum agent capability improvement?\n- Resource allocation efficiency across different workstreams\n\n## LEARN Agent: Strategic System Adjustment\n\n**Higher-order changes to how SGHC operates:**\n\n### SGHC Prompt Engineering\n- MEASURE shows agents not using X workflow \u2192 Update SGHC system prompt to emphasize X patterns\n- Success rate analysis suggests SGHC should be more/less conservative in task decomposition\n\n### Subagent Orchestration Adjustments  \n- \"Your debugging subagent should always check dependencies first based on recent failure patterns\"\n- Adjust which specialized subagents SGHC spawns for different contexts\n\n### Strategic Development Direction\n- Based on ROI analysis, shift focus from feature X to infrastructure Y\n- Recommend new agent types that should be developed based on capability gaps\n\n### Meta-Workflow Creation\n- Create new higher-level workflows for SGHC project management based on successful patterns\n- Design new agent coordination protocols when current ones show inefficiencies\n\n## The True RSI Loop\n\n\n\n**MEASURE and LEARN are the meta-cognitive layer that optimizes the optimization system itself.**\n\nThis creates **true recursive self-improvement** because the system improves its own improvement capabilities, not just its task execution capabilities.\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n### MEASURE Agent Capabilities\n- Agent history analysis and pattern detection\n- Plan vs execution variance tracking\n- Workflow recommendation system evaluation\n- System bug detection from execution patterns\n- ROI and efficiency metrics calculation\n\n### LEARN Agent Capabilities  \n- SGHC system prompt modification\n- Subagent orchestration strategy updates\n- Development priority recommendations\n- Meta-workflow design and implementation\n- Strategic direction analysis and adjustment\n\n**Dependencies**: Builds on semantic task system, workflow learning, and Neo4j knowledge graph\n\n**Enables**: True autonomous development with recursive self-improvement capabilities",

Structured Idea Templates\n- Ideas should require specific labels/metadata in frontmatter:\n```yaml\n---\ntype: feature  < /dev/null |  bug | enhancement | marketing | philosophy\npriority: high | medium | low  \ndomain: core | tools | workflows | business | content\nstatus: idea\n---\n```\n\n### 2. Auto-Processing Pipeline\n- Parse idea file metadata\n- Convert to issue with appropriate labels\n- Route to correct workflows based on labels\n- Auto-assign to appropriate project boards/buckets\n\n### 3. Label-Based Workflows\nDifferent labels trigger different processing:\n- `type: marketing` \u2192 routes to content team workflows\n- `type: feature` \u2192 routes to development workflows  \n- `priority: high` \u2192 auto-adds to sprint planning\n- `domain: business` \u2192 routes to business strategy bucket\n\n### 4. Bucket Organization\nIdeas automatically sorted into buckets:\n- **Development Backlog** (type: feature, enhancement, bug)\n- **Marketing Queue** (type: marketing, content)\n- **Philosophy/Strategy** (type: philosophy, business)\n- **Research Projects** (domain: research)\n\n### Benefits\n- Less manual triage of ideas\n- Better organization from the start\n- Automated routing to appropriate teams/workflows\n- Clearer idea status tracking\n- Easier to find related ideas\n\n## Implementation\n- Update promote-idea-to-issue.yml workflow\n- Add frontmatter parsing\n- Create label-based routing rules\n- Set up auto-assignment to projects\n- Create idea template files",

      "title": "Hierarchical Meta-Repo System - Solving organizational project management with YAML configs",
      "description": "This issue documents the hierarchical meta-repo system for universal project management across any scale.\n\n## User Quote Explaining the Core Insight\n\n> my point is actually that even if you have the personal meta-repo, when you complete a task, you update the issue in some other repo. i was saying that is easily achievable likely in many ways mainly through workflows and labels from workflows... but i was remarking that having both that system and a deeper middle aspect of organization whereby individual repos can aggregate from the repos that are aprt of what they represent (like if you have a meta-repo that holds links to repos from a number of other codebases in the same overall ecosystem, and that is really just a codebase type, like for example google, facebook, hyperon, whatever). Then you have both: the individual that miay be working on tasks inside any type of repo... we would still aggregate all the aggregated tasks from meta-repos to the personal ones, but we would need to differentiate between them: if is personal_repo or is meta_repo then aggregate, if is sub_repo do not.\n\n> oh shit so we actually solved the organizational problem too. Now all it is is a bool inside of a yaml that tells github which type of repo you have and your personal meta-repo reflects them appropriately and aggregates from them appropriately, and ecosystem meta-repos tagged appropriately aggregate appropriately and feed into the personal meta-repo appropriately\n\n## The Solution: Three-Tier Hierarchy\n\n### 1. Personal Meta-Repos\n- Aggregate everything a developer works on\n- Top level of the hierarchy\n- Shows all work without duplication\n\n### 2. Ecosystem Meta-Repos  \n- Aggregate related projects (e.g., 'google-ecosystem', 'heaven-ecosystem')\n- Middle tier that groups related repos\n- Feed into personal meta-repos\n\n### 3. Standard Repos\n- Actual code repositories\n- Leaf nodes that don't aggregate\n- Feed into ecosystem meta-repos if tagged\n\n## Implementation: Simple YAML Config\n\n```yaml\n# .github/heaven-config.yml\nrepo_type: personal_meta  < /dev/null |  ecosystem_meta | standard_repo\nparent_ecosystem: heaven  # optional, links to ecosystem meta\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. **Standard repos** have their issues/tasks\n2. **Ecosystem meta-repos** aggregate from their child repos\n3. **Personal meta-repos** aggregate from ecosystems + standalone repos\n4. **Smart filtering** prevents duplicate aggregation\n\n## The Magic\n\n- Scales from individual developers to massive organizations\n- No complex infrastructure - just YAML + GitHub Actions\n- Progressive enhancement - add to existing repos as needed\n- New repos created by agents have everything pre-configured\n\n## Adoption Strategy\n\n- **Existing repos**: 'Add our workflows, set your flags, you're good to go'\n- **New repos**: 'Everything just works out of the box'\n- **Customization**: 'Something missing? Just tweak the flags'\n\nThis creates a distributed, declarative project management system that scales infinitely using only GitHub's existing infrastructure plus our workflow automations.",

      "description": "SGHC Computer Use Agent with VNC Targeting\n\nGoal: Build computer use agent capability that can target any VNC port, load VNC on containers, and execute computer use tasks in sandboxed environments.\n\nArchitecture Overview:\n- VNC container orchestration for sandbox environments\n- Computer use agent that can target specific VNC ports\n- MCP-based approach for cross-container execution\n- Agent coordination between main agent and computer use subagent\n\nImplementation Approach:\n- Load MCP on target container\n- Call MCP through bash from orchestrating container  \n- VNC targeting allows computer use agent to interact with any sandboxed environment\n- Enables full frontend and backend testing in isolated environments\n\nCore Components:\n- VNC container management system\n- Computer use agent with VNC port targeting\n- MCP integration for cross-container communication\n- Sandbox environment provisioning\n- Agent coordination for task handoffs\n\nUse Cases:\n- Test frontend applications in sandboxed browsers\n- Run and test backend services in isolated environments  \n- Full stack testing with computer use automation\n- Autonomous development environment management\n\nBenefits:\n- Enables autonomous testing and validation\n- Sandboxed execution prevents system contamination\n- Scalable to multiple concurrent environments\n- Foundation for fully autonomous development cycles\n\nIntegration Points:\n- SGHC build automation workflow\n- TreeKanban issue execution\n- BrainAgent task coordination\n- Neo4j workflow validation\n\nImplementation Estimate: 3-7 days depending on MCP integration complexity",

Instead of imposing sophisticated templating systems like Progenitor upfront, we begin with basic meta-cognitive agents using simple prompts.\n\nAs the system recognizes its own limitations, it writes increasingly sophisticated prompts for itself. The cognitive architecture drives prompt evolution, not the reverse. This creates a natural progression where advanced templating emerges as the system's own solution to repeated prompt-writing patterns, making the Progenitor framework the discovered endpoint rather than the imposed starting point. \n\nThe intelligence comes from the meta-cognitive architecture; prompts are just the serialization format that evolves with the system's growing self-awareness.",
